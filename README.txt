-------Learnings-------

- as soon as you code more than you think, something is wrong (unless the solution is super obvious)
- planning a project previously and reading about common approaches to problems (e.g. parsing) is extremely helpful
- be sure about requirements before doing research on how to solve them (here this would have been: inform about shell behaviour and edge cases, weird behaviour etc.)
- take more time to find good sources (here the source code, bash manual and hackernoon shell tutorial are most important, would they have been found right at the beginning, research would have went smoother)
- running bash in a debugger and using strace would have been extremely helpful from the beginning

- importance of modular project structure
