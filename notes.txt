---------functions---------------

- readline
	read a line from stdin
- rl_clear_history
	clears history list
- rl_on_new_line
	Tell the update functions that we have moved onto a new (empty) line, usually after outputting a newline.
- rl_replace_line
	Replace the contents of rl_line_buffer with text. The point and mark are preserved, if possible. If clear_undo is non-zero, the undo list associated with the current line is cleared.
- rl_redisplay
	Change whatâ€™s displayed on the screen to reflect the current contents of rl_line_buffer.
- add_history
	adds a line to history

	- processes tokens according to grammar and stores them in the command table
- executor
- shell subsystems
	- environment variables
	- wildcards
