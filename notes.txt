----------approach-------------

- understand last two requirements' logic
- structure the requirements into a project structure oriented toward the actual bash shell
- implement the structure step by step while making sure the implemented bit works exactly like bash by testing and reading shell manual


----------logic-------------

- parser 
	- lexical analyser takes input and puts it together into tokens
	- processes tokens according to grammar and stores them in the command table
- executor
- shell subsystems
	- environment variables
	- wildcards
